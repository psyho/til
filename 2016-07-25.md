# WebAssembly - a new compile-target for the web

https://webassembly.github.io/

WebAssembly looks like taking asm.js to the next step. It's a binary format to which other programming languages can compile to (so bytecode?), that will be more efficient, than compiling to asm.js. It's backed by all of the major browser vendors, so it seems like it might actually take off at some point.

# ownCloud - open source Google Drive replacement

https://owncloud.org

I'm not sure if it's a full Google Apps replacement (I think it can do Calendar and Docs, but not sure about Gmail), but it looks like you can use it to replace Google Drive if you are into hosting stuff like that yourself.
