# Branch by abstraction

Link: [Martin Fowler's description][1].

Not so much a new approach, but it's something I didn't know had a name.

Branch by abstraction is a very helpful technique that allows gradually introducing a change to the codebase, without forcing you to default on using long-lived feature branches.

The basic idea is that you:

1. Identify the piece of code that needs to change
2. Introduce an abstraction around the piece of code
3. Incrementally change the clients of that initial piece of code to use the new abstraction. Notice how this doesn't have to be a big-bang, all at once change. It's possible, and quite easy to do this while continuously integrating with other changes as they come along.
4. Once you are done with switching to the new abstraction, you can start working on the replacement implementation.
5. Once you finish a subset of functionality that fully satisfies the needs of some clients, you can replace the implementation used by these clients (in my experience, this would often be conditional on a feature flag, so that the change can be easily rolled back if it turns out to be somehow incompatible).
6. You add functionality to the new abstraction and convert clients until reaching full parity with the original.

It's a really useful technique, and I'm really glad to finally have learned the name for it.
