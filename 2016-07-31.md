# Antifragile

["The New Normal"][new-normal] series of blog posts by Michael Nygard.

["Cognicast Episode 106"][cognicast-106] podcast with Michael Nygard discussing the series.

## Notes

"Antifragile" sounds like a buzzword, and perhaps it is.
However, I think it highlights a real problem that many people are running into.

More and more of the systems we build these days are distributed systems.
Microservices specifically come to mind (and are called out in the blog posts), but most companies that have more than a few developers probably operate multiple independently-deployed services that talk to each other.

I think it's quite obvious from the purely technical standpoint, that dealing with functionality spread over many independently-deployed and operated services requires a different approach than the same functionality being spread across many modules in a monolithic code base. Embracing failure is definitely a key component here.

What I found really interesting, and something that didn't cross my mind before, is how important it is to embrace failure on the organizational level as well.
This is very unintuitive - most people try to prevent bad things from happening, instead of optimizing for recovery after a failure.

I think this is also a very big risk in adopting more complex (failure-wise) architectures like Microservices.
Since people are naturally predisposed to prevent failures, it's very easy for an executive who does not understand the principles behind antifragile to get scared by an instance of downtime and institute measures that will over the long term take away any agility that the company had and lead to it having been overtaken by competitors.

I like working in small teams, on small codebases, so Microservices hold a certain appeal for me, but this series of articles has really highlighted how important is organizational buy-in with this architecture.
