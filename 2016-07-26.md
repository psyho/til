# A day with Spacemacs

After having tried around a year ago, and ultimately going back to VIM, I went back to using [Spacemacs][spacemacs] today.

Spacemacs is for Emacs, what oh-my-zsh is for ZSH. It provides an opinionated, batteries-included configuration. 
More importantly, it's built around, so called, Evil Mode. This is a VIM emulation mode that brings modal editing (which I love) to Emacs.

The fact that Spacemacs is built round Evil matters a lot, since it wraps many (most?) of the popular Emacs plugins and provides Evil Mode-friendly
keybindings for them. This means that you don't have to do [stuff like this][evil-org-mode] yourself.

## My Observations

After having used Spacemacs for a day, below are a couple of things I learned.

### Emacs is more discoverable than VIM

Emacs is much more discoverable than VIM. Pretty much anything you can do is a function, and you can list and search through all the functions by simply using the `M-X` keyboard shortcut. I can't stress how awesome it is when learning a new editor. Even if I don't know the key combination to do something, this is a relly fast and convenient finding and launching available editor functions. Once you know the function name, you can also trivially assign it a keyboard shortcut of your liking.

### Spacemacs is more discoverable than Emacs

What makes Spacemacs even more discoverable, is it's Helm integration. The keyboard shoftcuts in Spacemacs usually start with `SPC` (space) followed by one or more characters. Every time you press a key, it opens a menu listing all the keys that can follow and their corresponding functions. The functions are also groupped in a fairly logical way, so it's quite easy to learn the combinations. For example, `SPC f e d` (`f` is for files, `e` is for Emacs, `d` is for dotfile) opens your `.spacemacs` file. Easy to find, logical, easy to remember. Beautiful.

### Spacemacs embraces the batteries-included philosophy

Spacemacs groups related plugins into so-called Layers. By including a layer into your configuration file, you typically include more than one plugin, plus some custom configuration to make it work with Spacemacs and it's particular style of keybindings.

### Org mode is insane

It's insane, and I mean it in a good way. It's like markdown on crack. On the surface, its just a markup language - you get some headers, bullet lists, bold text, italic text, links, etc. Dive a little deeper, and you get TODOs, tagging, etc. Dig even deeper, and you get a Pomodoro timer integrated into your IDE, time tracking, agenda view spanning multiple files, tables that have spreadsheet-like functionality, live code samples (embed a code sample and run it from within a document). Insane I tells ya!

Insane or not, I tracked my Pomodoro backlog in it today and it worked really well. It wish it had some way of tracking my estimates, but I'm sure it's just a question of figuring it out.

### Magit is... weird

It seems like it might be more powerful than Fugitive, which I have been using for the last couple of years, but it's also pretty unfamiliar, so I'll probably have to just spend more time with it to appreciate it.

### Ruby integration works

I didn't get the code navigation features to work too well yet, so that kind of sucks, but for now I get around by fuzzy-searching through file names. It does however have a working RSpec integration, which makes me consider switching from running guard and the editor side by side, to running specs directly from the editor. We'll see how it goes.

## Summing up

Switching to Spacemacs has been suprisingly smooth so far. I spent around 3 pomodoros of my workday today on it, and I have most of the functionality that I had available in VIM already. I think this time I might actually stick with Spacemacs for the long term.
