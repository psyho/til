# Lambda Island and Phoenix talks

## Lambda Island

I just found out today that there's a service similar to Ruby Tapas/RailsCasts, but for Clojure.
It's apparently pretty new (just 12 episodes at the time of writing this), but I'm quite fond of the aforementioned screencasts, so I signed up for it.

## Phoenix Talks

I watched [two][1] [talks][2] about the Phoenix Web Framework last night.
We are considering expanging our stack at Zoomer, and Elixir is one of the contending technologies (the other being Clojure, guess which one I'd pick?).

I've always been very impressed, yet quite intimidated by Erlang.
While in the past, I would have passed it up without a second thought when it comes to general web development, the times are changing, and with them, the requirements that stand before the technologies we use.

There is more of an expectation these days, for websites to update automatically, without any action from the user.
In fact, I expect most of the SPAs to transition to a [reactive query model][3] (as opposed by today's RESTful APIs) in the next decade.
This puts a burden on the service, to either maintain a server capable of accepting and maintaining persistent connections, or integrating with a 3rd party provider.

Erlang might be the best at supporting zillions of WebSocket connections, but I still need to be convinced that Elixir can also deliver on making the day-to-day, CRUDy stuff bearable.
From what I've seen so far however, it certainly looks very promising.
