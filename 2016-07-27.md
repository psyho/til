# 3 Talks from Clojure/Conj

Yesterday I had some time to watch a couple of conference talks, while I was painting minis. Below are my notes.

## Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Design in Clojure

### Notes

The presenter took upon himself an ambitious task of comparing top-down vs bottom-up design in Clojure.
Unfortunately, it seems that he considers "top-down" design to be the same thing I would call "bottom-up, inheritance-heavy case of frameworkitis".
Because of that, most of the comparison part of the talk is basically useless, but there are still parts of it that relate to the bottom-up design that are interesting.

### Bottom-up design

Bottom-up design in Clojure starts with imagining the *shape* of the data structures we will be using. 
It's important to highlight the shape part of that sentence, since in Clojure it's common to stick with the built in data structures instead of using custom types.

Once we have the data, we can move on to figuring out what functions we need to transform this data.
These functions are usually fairly simple - just a couple of lines of code, building up from smaller, more specialized ones.

Functions can be composed more easily than objects.
There are a couple of reasons for this:

* When using a minimal set of data types, some functions have more opportunity for re-useles.
* Functions are a smaller unit of abstraction, then objects, which combine data and often multiple methods to work on that data.
* When composing objects, the client code is coupled to the method names on that object. When composing functions, the call interface is uniform across all functions, so there's less coupling and it's easier to use a function, since there's less adapting necessary in most cases.

The above advantages apply to all idiomatic Clojure code, so they are quite orthogonal to whether the app was designed in a top-down or a bottom up way.

### Top-down design

To me top-down design follows a process similar to the following:

* Start with a test describing a feature from the user's perspective (or on the boundary of the system).
* Use that test to drive your progress as you drill down into system, implementing the bits you need as needed.
* Use "programming by wishful thinking". As you implement a piece of code, assume that all the bits are needed are alrady implemented and use stubbing/mocking to provide them. This is what drives the design of your system and gives the method it's name: "top-down design".

The method outlined above has been working for me really well for the last couple of years in Ruby and JS applications.
However, while Clojure certainly supports it, it seems that it's not the idiomatic approach in this language.

First of all, top-down design tends to rely heavily on Inversion of Control and stubbing.
In Clojure, it's quite typical to hard code references to used functions within your code.
Stubbing support is also not a prominent feature of Clojure testing frameworks.

Another aspect of Clojure that suggests that top-down design is not idiomatic, is the strong focus on property-based testing.
These tests are great at preventing regressions and validating correctness of the implementation, but they do a pretty lousy job of driving design.

### Summary

The presentation was so-so, but it drove me to thinking about top-down vs bottom-up design.
While I still don't know what the best approach is, I think I'll try switching to bottom-up for the next piece of code I write in Clojure, and see where that gets me.

## ClojureScript for Skeptics

### Notes

I would recommend showing that presentation to anyone you want to convince to try ClojureScript.
It talks about different points people raise against the technology and how they can be debunked.
On top of that, it also talks about the legitimate challenges to adoption, making it not just a sales pitch, but a fairly honest review.

## Mobile Apps with ClojureScript

### Notes

This is an experience-report type of talk about developing native mobile apps in ClojureScript.
This is possible thanks to the magic of React Native, which I believe has an excellent value proposition, because it allows you to share the most complex pieces of your logic across the different mobile platforms while still utilizing the native look & feel provided by Android and iOS SDKs.

I was a little disappointed that the presenter did not explore the Android side of React Native and could not share any battle stories from that.
It's not just because it's possible that React Native for Android might have some sharp edges, but also because I wanted to know some more about the reality of sharing code between different platforms.
One thing I worry about with this type of re-use, is the very deep level of coupling that introduces. 
When differnt applications integrate through a well-defined boundary, like an API, it eliminates a whole class of errors that can happen when they share code, assuming the life cycles of these applications are different (whic I think is the case when sharing code between different client platforms and potentially the server).

Overall, I got the impression, that while React Native is usable from ClojureScript, it's still at the point where you are forced to do a lot of extra work to wrap the native controls.
